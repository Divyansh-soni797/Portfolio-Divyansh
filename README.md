## 💬 My Experience
Working on this project helped me understand Tailwind CSS much better. I learned how utility classes work and how to structure a website without writing any custom CSS. ✨

It was fun experimenting with layouts, colors, and responsive design. Now I have a **personal website that truly represents me**!
